# Reinforcement-learning-in-an-agent-based-model-of-thermoregulatory-huddling
### Overview
This project aims to discover how social dynamics could emerge from interactions between individuals. The physiological huddling and filial huddling are implemented, which helps to solve the objective with the outputs generated by them. 

### Files Description
- model-physiological_huddling.cpp: The model is to simulate the physiological huddling.
- model.cpp: This model is to simulate the filial huddling.
- plot_temp_huddling.py: Plot graphs of body temperature and huddling under different ambient temperatures.
- graph.py: Plot graphs of huddling and association between agents
- vis.py: Visualization of the agents' movements.


### Running
1. Run the model-physiological_huddling.cpp
```bash
g++ model-physiological_huddling.cpp -o physiological_huddling
```
```bash
./physiological_huddling
```
2. Run the model.cpp
```bash
g++ model.cpp -o model
```
- Output the output.txt with data from the no-learning model.
```bash
./model output.txt 0
```
- Output the learning.txt with data from the learning model.
```bash
./model learning.txt 1
```
3. Run the plot_temp_huddling.py
```bash
python plot_temp_huddling.py
```
4. Run the graph.py
```bash
python graph.py
```
5. Run the vis.py
```bash
python vis.py
```
